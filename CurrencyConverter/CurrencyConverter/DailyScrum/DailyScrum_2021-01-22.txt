1. What did I do Yesterday? 
- Started daily scrums. Merged my branch to the master, fixed conflicts. 

2. What will I do Today?
- Ask the teacher if I should create a scrum or document of my work before starting the daily
- scrums. Maybe check on my partner later in the day. If my partner has database covered, I will
- have to get connected to that database via azure, after that I can probably start working on the
- PowerPoint presentation. I’m thinking of working on it in teams so we can both add to it.

3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out? 
- No real problems here. Just thinking of what I want to do next.
