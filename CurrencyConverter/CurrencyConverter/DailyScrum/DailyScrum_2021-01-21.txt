1. What did I do Yesterday? 
- Found out that the project is due a whole week later than expected. Added Nathaniel’s code to 
- my code, edited them to fit together, tested, it works. Requested merge onto the master branch. 
- Created a backup for that and for my branch just in case.

2. What will I do Today?
- Start the daily scrums. Read presentations.txt, plan out what needs to be done. Maybe get the
- online database going. Not a whole lot in mind, since most of the project is pretty much done.

3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out? 
- Not much really, just waiting on that merge. I made a request to pull my branch to the master.
