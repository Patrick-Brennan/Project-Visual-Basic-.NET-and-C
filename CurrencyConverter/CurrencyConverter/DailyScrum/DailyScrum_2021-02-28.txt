1. What did I do Yesterday? 
- Planned out what we're going to do on a two day notice. Created a database for the project. Attempted adding in a database to the project.
-  Attempted changing the result label into a list view. Changed the cs file of the main window around a bit to fit the database.
- Made a backup branch for the database work. Attempted adding in StreamWriter when the database wasn't working for me.
- Changed result name so the list view can show the output. Thought about adding a delete button to the window, but didn't get there.
- Attempted IOException for StreamWriter. Changed the cs file of the main window around a bit to fit StreamWriter.

2. What will I do Today?
- Just work on the presentation, no time for code other than a few fixes I might do. Also practice the presentation.

3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out? 
- Teacher expecting major changes on short notice. Either check on us sooner or don't expect big changes.
